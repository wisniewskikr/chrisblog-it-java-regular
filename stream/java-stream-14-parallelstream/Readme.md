##### Goal

In Java, **parallelStream()** is a method used on collections that creates a parallel stream for processing. A parallel stream enables parallel execution of tasks, dividing the workload across multiple threads in a fork-join pool, which can improve performance for large data sets. It's a way to leverage multicore processors for data processing with minimal coding effort.

##### Goal

In Java, the **Collectors.groupingBy** function is used with Java Streams to group elements of a collection based on a specified classifier function. This classifier function determines the "grouping key," which is typically an attribute of each element. The result is a Map where each key is associated with a list of elements that share that key.

##### Predicate

N/A

##### Result

Map

##### Description

Collectors.groupingBy is like "GROUP BY" for databases.

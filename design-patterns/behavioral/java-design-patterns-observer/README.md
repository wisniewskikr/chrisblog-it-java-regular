## Goal

Goal of this project is to create **Observer** behavioral design pattern.

## Explanation

**The Observer Design Pattern** is a behavioral pattern that allows an object, known as the subject, to notify its dependent objects, known as observers, when there is a change in its state. This pattern is useful when an object needs to notify multiple objects about changes without having to tightly couple them.

## Hints

Hints:
* Create interface Observer
* Create class which implement Observer
* Create class Subject with addObserver() method. This class should also have method addMessage() which will notify Observers

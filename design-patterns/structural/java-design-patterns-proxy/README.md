## Goal

Goal of this project is to create **Proxy** structural design pattern.

## Explanation

**The Proxy Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is useful in situations where direct access to the object might be too expensive or complicated.

## Hints

Hints:
* Create interface HelloWorld
* Create real class which implements HelloWorld
* Create proxy class which implements HelloWorld. This class should take as an argument real class
* Call proxy method which will do some actions around real method and call real method

## Goal

Goal of this project is to create **Prototype** creational design pattern.

## Explanation

**The Prototype Design Pattern** is part of the Creational Patterns in object-oriented design. It allows for the creation of new objects by copying or cloning existing ones (prototypes). This pattern is useful when object creation is costly or time-consuming, and you want to avoid repeated instantiation.

## Hints

Hints:
* Create clone() methods which returns new Prototype (clone/copy of Prototype)

CLONE CLONEABLE SOPHISTICATED
=============================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The goal of this project is to show how clone sophisticated Java class using Cloneable interface.

To use this solution every class which should be copied - parent and child - has to implements interface Cloneable. Moreover every class has to implement method clone() because by default Java creates **shallow copy**.

**Summary**
Cloneable interface is quite hard to use. Much more better solution is create clone of class by Json. How to do it please check project **json-gson**.


USAGE
-----

Please open class **Main** and run method **main()**.

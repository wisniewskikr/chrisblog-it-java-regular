## Goal

Goal of this project is to create application which will find index of the element in the array using **Interpolation Search**. It's improvement of **Binary Search**. 

Binary Search info:
* Good for huge amount of data
* Result provided in average 0(log(log n)) time. Worst case 0(n)
* Requires sorted data!

##### Hints
Hints:
* Array has to be sorted
* We need 3 variables: right, left, probe
* We have to use the loop "while"
* We have to narrow results until we find our target or return -1

##### Complexity

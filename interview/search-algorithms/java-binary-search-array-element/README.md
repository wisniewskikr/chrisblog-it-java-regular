## Goal

Goal of this project is to create application which will find index of the element in the array using **Binary Search**. Binary Search means that array has to be sorted and then we check in the middle. If value is lower then middle then we check in the middle of left side. If value is higher then the middle the we check in the middle of right side.

Binary Search info:
* Good for huge amount of data
* Result provided in 0(log n) time
* Requires sorted data!

##### Hints
Hints:
* Array has to be sorted
* We need 3 variables: right, left, middle
* We have to use the loop "while"
* We have to narrow results until we find our target or return -1

##### Complexity

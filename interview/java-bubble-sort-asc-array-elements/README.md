## Goal

Goal of this project is to create application which will sort elements in array using Bubble Sort. It means that in first iteration last element is set, then one before last etc.

##### Hint
Hints:
* Use two loops
* Use tmp variable to replace two elements
* Always higher value should be second
* Use boolean "swapped" if there was some change during iteration. If false then you can finish iteration - array was sorted.

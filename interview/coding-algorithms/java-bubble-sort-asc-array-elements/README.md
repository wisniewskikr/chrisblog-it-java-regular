## Goal

Goal of this project is to create application which will sort elements in array using Bubble Sort. It means that in first iteration last element is set, then one before last etc.

##### Hint
Hints:
* Use two loops
* Use tmp variable to replace two elements
* Always higher value should be second
* Use boolean "swapped" if there was some change during iteration. If false then you can finish iteration - array was sorted.

##### Terminology
The name "Bubble Sort" comes from the way the algorithm works, resembling bubbles rising to the surface in water. In this sorting algorithm, elements are repeatedly compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. The largest unsorted element "bubbles" to the top (or end) of the list during each pass, just like bubbles in water rise upward.

Here’s why it’s called that:

* Bubble-like behavior: In each iteration, the largest element "floats" to its correct position (like a bubble), while smaller elements gradually move upward through subsequent passes.
* Step-by-step swapping: The algorithm works by repeatedly "bubbling up" the largest unsorted value until it reaches the end of the array.
Although it's a simple algorithm, it's inefficient for large lists and is mainly used for educational purposes.

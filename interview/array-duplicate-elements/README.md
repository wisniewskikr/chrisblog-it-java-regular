ARRAY DUPLICATE ELEMENTS
========================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Goal of this project is to show how to find duplicate elements in array.

This problem can be resolved in 3 ways:
- **HashSet**: we use here feature of HashSet that when you try to add second the same element then you get "false"; 
- **HashMap**: we create map with element as key and count as value. If element does not exist in map then we set "1" and when exists then we increment;
- **Brute Force**: we use two loops which check every element each other;


USAGE
-----

Please open class **Main** and run method **main()**.

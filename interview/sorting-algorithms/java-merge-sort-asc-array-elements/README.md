## Goal

Goal of this project is to present how to sort array using **Merge Sort** alghoritm. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

Info:
* Acceptable huge amount of data
* Result provided in 0(n log n) time
* But it uses more space then Bubble Sort

##### Hints
Hints:
* Use WHILE loop x 4
* Use variables: size, leftSize, rightSize
* Use variables: i, l, r

##### Complexity

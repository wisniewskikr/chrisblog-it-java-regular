## Goal

Goal of this project is to create application which will sort elements in array using **Bubble Sort**. It means that in first iteration last element is set, then one before last etc.

Info:
* Acceptable for small amount data
* Result provided in 0(n2) time

##### Hint
Hints:
* Use two loops
* Use tmp variable to replace two elements
* Always higher value should be second
* Use boolean "swapped" if there was some change during iteration. If false then you can finish iteration - array was sorted.

##### Complexity

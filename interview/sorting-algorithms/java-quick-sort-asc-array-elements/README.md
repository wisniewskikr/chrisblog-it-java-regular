## Goal

Goal of this project is to present how to sort array in Java using **Quick Sort** strategy. Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements in an array.

Info:
* Use fot huge amount of data
* Result provided avarage in 0(n log n) time
* Result provided in worst case in 0(n2) time (if collection is already sorted)
* It uses more space then Bubble Sort but less then Merge Sort

##### Hints
Hints:
* Use methods quickSort(array, start, end) and partition(array, start, end)
* Use variables pivot, i, j
* Use swapping with temp variable

##### Complexity

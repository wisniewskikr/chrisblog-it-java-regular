ARRAY MISSING NUMBER
====================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Goal of this project is to show how to find missing number in array.

This task can be resolved in following ways:
- **Many missing numbers**: create new temporary array. Index in this array should be values from input array. So after all if index is "0" then number is missing;
- **Many missing numbers and BitSet**: BitSet by method nextClearBit() provides missing keys;
- **One missing number**: math statement: sum = count * (count + 1) / 2.


USAGE
-----

Please open class **Main** and run method **main()**.

MERGING AND SORTING SETS OF OBJECTS
===================================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Goal of this project is to show how to merge and sort sets of objects in Java. 


THEORY
------

You should use Set if you want to be sure that elements in this Collection are unique.

Types:
* **HashSet**: use it if you donâ€™t want to maintain any order of elements. It has the fastest performance;
* **LinkedHashSet**: use it if you want to maintain insertion order of elements. It is slower then HashSet but faster then TreeSet;
* **TreeSet**: user it if you want to sort the elements according to some Comparator. It has the slower performance because it has to do sorting every time.


USAGE
-----

Please open class **Main** and run method **main()**.

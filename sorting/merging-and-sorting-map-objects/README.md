MERGING AND SORTING MAPS OF OBJECTS
====================================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Goal of this project is to show how to merge and sort maps of objects in Java. 


THEORY
------

You should use Map if you want to be use Collection type Key-Value.

Types:
* **HashMap**: use it if you donâ€™t want to maintain any order of elements. It has the fastest performance;
* **LinkedHashMap**: use it if you want to maintain insertion order of elements. It is slower then HashSet but faster then TreeSet;
* **TreeMap**: user it if you want to sort the elements according to some Comparator. It has the slower performance because it has to do sorting every time.


USAGE
-----

Please open class **Main** and run method **main()**.

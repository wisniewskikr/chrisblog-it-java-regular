SORTING ARRAY PRIMITIVE
=======================


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Goal of this project is to show how to sort primitive arrays in Java. You can do it in following ways:
- **manually**: using loops - without any help class;
- **stream**: using Arrays.stream() method - reverse in more complicated because you have to convert int to Integer and after sorting again to int;
- **common utils**: method Arrays.sort() is used for ascending. And CommonUtils is used for descending;
- **guava**: guava converts array of int to collection of Integers. Then for sorting you can use Collections.


USAGE
-----

Please open class **Main** and run method **main()**.
